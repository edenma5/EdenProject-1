            <h2>Mardi Gras holiday in New Orleans</h2>
            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each
                day
                (weather permitting). many days have several large parades. In the final week, many events occur
                throughout
                New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes, most follow the same parade
                schedule and route each year.

            <h2>A little history</h2>
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice.
                The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown.
                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                Civil
                War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
                In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed
                after being struck and run over in between interconnected "tandem floats" towed by a single vehicle.
                Following the incident during the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address
                safety
                issues with these floats (including outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a
                barrier).

            <h2>Traditional colors</h2>
            <p>
                The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold.
                The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors.
                It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen.
                some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed
                to any
                true symbolism.

            <h2>So what can be seen there?</h2>
            <p>Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic,
                and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men
                and
                boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and
                appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen
                with
                heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads
                and
                bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade
                and
                march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the
                streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour
                broadcast
                as they wend their reckless way.
