                    <div class="answer">
                        There is a city ordinance in Orleans Parish that prohibits Mardi Gras from being commercialized,
                        i.e., no advertising is
                        allowed on floats or can be thrown from floats. In addition, some of the Mardi Gras
                        organizations have events outside of
                        their actual parade where sponsors can participate. These include Zulu’s Lundi Gras Festival,
                        Endymion’s big bash before
                        their parade, Metairie’s “Family Gras”, and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of our
                        parades (such as Bacchus,
                        Endymion, Orpheus).

                        The date of Mardi Gras changes every year because it's connected to Easter, which can fall on

                        23 and April 25. Mardi Gras day always takes place 47 days before Easter.

                        The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They

                        presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.

                        Twelfth Night (aka, Twelfth Night, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is celebrated
                        on January 6th in New

                        not. According to Wikipedia, different traditions mark the date of Twelfth Night as either
                        January 5 or January 6 (it
                        depends on whether they start counting the twelve days on December 25 or 26).

                        Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see
                        question below) and ends
                        on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins. It
                        is also common for
                        people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi
                        Gras Day." Locals tend
                        to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are "Mardi
                        Gras."
